# Learning Spring (Core, Boot, Batch)

Welcome to the my Learning Spring repository! This repository is about my learning and practicing Spring Framework, including Spring Core, Spring Boot, and Spring Batch.

## Overview

This repository contains multiple projects and examples to help you get to know about my learning with the following Spring technologies:
- **Spring Core**: The fundamental building block of Spring applications, focusing on dependency injection and aspect-oriented programming.
- **Spring Boot**: Simplifies the development of production-ready applications by providing default configurations and opinionated setups.
- **Spring Batch**: A robust batch processing framework designed to handle large volumes of data and complex batch jobs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- An IDE of your choice (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.) I preffer Intellij IDEA

### Installation
